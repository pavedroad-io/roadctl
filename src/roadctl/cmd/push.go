  Usage roadctl push [repository]
  
  All images will be pushed unless a specific one is specified on the command line

  Options:
    --repository = URL|path`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
    fmt.Println("pushing image userMager to https://github.com/pavedroad.io/images")

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// pushCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// pushCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
